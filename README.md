# Introduction to Voyant
This is the repository created for an in-class introduction to Voyant including: uploading a corpus, stopwords, general features, exercises and added resources. 

## Voyant is
Voyant is a webbased tool or set of tools displayed in one interface. Voyant can be run either in a browser in which case you are accessing a remote server. Or downloaded to your desktop, running on your local server. 

Voyant is a set of tools for computational text analysis or text mining. Voyant enables both distant and close reading of large bodies of text; a corpus. 

## Tips for first use - uploading your data
Go to Voyant.org. 
You can either open an excisting corpus or upload a remote corpus. 

After uploading the corpus on the main page, you will reach the analysis interface that has five tools for text analysis by default. 

Here is a quick explanation of each tool:
* Cirrus: word cloud that shows the most frequent terms in the corpus. 
* Reader: space for the revision and reading of the complete texts with a bar graph that indicates the amount of text of each document. 
* Trends: distribution chart that shows the terms throughout the corpus (or within a document when only one is uploaded). 
* Summary: provides an overview of textual statistics of the corpus, like readability, density and average words per sentence. 
* Contexts: co-occurence of a keyword with the immediate textual context. 

You can remove and add different tools to the interface depending on your needs. 

## Stop words - cleaning your data
Stop words are a central feature when performing natural language processing or text mining. 
Stop words are a collection of words like the, then, if, or, some, what, and of.
The stop word list can be edited and tokens (words, symbols, digits) can be removed or added as best to ensure a (relatively) clean set of data. 


## Exercise 1 - contrast and compare stories by H. C Andersen vs the Grimm brothers (in groups of two or three) 
1. Upload the H. C Andersen corpus. Like in the first excersice, make sure the stop word list is edited. 
2. Again, which insights into the fairy tales of H. C Andersen and the Grimm brothers can Voyant provide? 
3. Check numbers for density, readability and the co-ocurence of words. Specifically pay attention to the tool Contexts. 
4. Repeat the process for the Grimm brothers corpus in a separate browser window. 
5. Do you see differences between the two corpora? If so, what are the main differences? 

##  Exercise 2 - inqure and experiment (in groups of two or three)
1. Upload a text or put together a corpus from Gutenberg to Voyant. Remember to do this in a plain text format (txt). 
2. Find the “Options” button and edit or view the list of “Stopwords.” Does this change your results?
3. What can Voyant tell you about the use of words in the corpus? For example, which are the most frequent words?
4. Check the numbers for density, readability and the co-occurence of words. 
5. Do some words become more used at specific times throughout the timeline for the corpus? Is it possible to get an idea of the most important topics (not words), in each text?
6. What happens when you hover your mouse over different
parts of the Cirrus widget? 
7. What can you learn about this corpus from the wordcloud?

## Bonus Exercise 3 - Choose your own adventure and explore 
1. Find the drop-down menu and choose a new tool we haven’t looked
at yet
2. What is it called?
3. How do you interact with it?
4. What do you learn from it?
5. What is confusing about it?
